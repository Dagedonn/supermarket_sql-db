 ðŸ›’ Supermarket Sales Database (SQL Project)

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

 About the Project

This project is a beginner SQL database simulation for a small supermarket. It was built to demonstrate my understanding of core SQL concepts, including:

- Creating a database

- Defining relational tables with appropriate data types

- Using PRIMARY KEY, IDENTITY, and FOREIGN KEY constraints

- Inserting structured data into tables

The project focuses on the foundations of SQL â€” which I'm currently mastering.

ðŸ“¦ Tables in the Project
Table	Description
Products	Stores product names and prices
Customers	Stores customer names, gender, city
Sales	Stores sales transactions (linked by IDs)

ðŸš€ Key SQL Concepts Practiced
CREATE DATABASE, USE, and CREATE TABLE

VARCHAR, DECIMAL, INT, DATE data types

INSERT INTO to populate tables

FOREIGN KEY relationships 

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objective
To build confidence writing clean and consistent SQL code from scratch, using proper data structure design â€” even without querying across multiple tables yet.

ðŸ“‚ How to Run It
Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or your preferred SQL tool

Run the script file supermarket_portfolio_script.sql

It will:

Create the database SupermarketDB

Create 3 related tables

Insert test data into each table

You can practice writing your own SELECT queries on top of this base.

ðŸ’¡ Whatâ€™s Next?
In future updates to this project, I plan to:

Add JOIN queries to analyze product and customer data

Calculate revenue and sales insights using GROUP BY and ORDER BY

Build reports on top-selling products and best customers
